# Coffee-Brewing-Application-in-Python
My first python coding project for the MIDS_W200 Data Science Programming course (Spring 2021)

There are still a few bugs in it, but are simple fixes. 

## How to run the program.  
1. Execute the main.py through linux shell.  
-application promot: Do you have an account (“Y”/”N”)?  
--(no) create_barista_account or log into barista account.  
--(yes) create account.  

2. User input  brew method (Pour-over, French Press, Flair espresso).  
--Display instructions.  

3 User input bean (region)  and roast (light, med, dark).  
--Display instructions. 

4. User enters final brew time.   

5. Program displays data → determines if time is within range of target.  
-If within the target: “Good job.”  
--The program displays flavor notes from bean class.  
-If above target: “YOU OVER EXTRACTED! Your coffee is likely too bitter and.”  
-If below target: “YOU UNDER EXTRACTED! Your coffee likely weak & sour

6. Program asks the user wants to save results
